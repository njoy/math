 * @brief Evaluated via Bonnet's recursion relation
 * @result The value of the Legendre series at @p x
 * @details 
 * This routine eschews evaluation of Legendre polynomials of order greater than
 * one. To accomplish this without compromising generality, Bonnet's recursion
 * relation is employed to express each Legendre polynomial in terms of a
 * weighted sum of lower order Legendre polynomials. Applied recusively, this
 * relation can be used to reduce a Legendre series evaluation to a monomial
 * evaluation.
